# EVE item diff

Item list diffing for EVE Online. Mainly developed for diffing fits, but
applications may be broader. The parser is packaged separately at
https://github.com/michaelmdresser/eve_item_parser. A practical application of
diffing can be found at the [EVE Item Diff](https://michaeldresser.io/eve-item-diff.html) site.

## WASM
